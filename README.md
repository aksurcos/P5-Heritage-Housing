# Heritage Housing Project

This is a basic, goal-driven Machine Learning Project to predict sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa.

* Click [here]("""""""""""""""""""""""""") to see live project.

## Business Case

* The client has supplied a dataset with house sale prices and other property attributes in order to accomplish prediction of sale prices. We aim to determine the best selling price for these residences as well as examine the ways in which particular property attributes affect their market worth.
* Business Requirements section has more details about what we are aiming.

## Dataset Content

* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements

As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

* Hypothesis 1: We suspect properties with greater Overall Quality will be priced higher.

* Hypothesis 2: We suspect properties with larger spaces will be priced higher.

* Hypothesis 3: We suspect the more recent the year of construction, the higher the sale price tends to be.


**Validation**

 - 1. The first hypothesis argument is supported by the fact of correlation analysis that homes with greater Overall Quality typically have higher sale prices.
 - 2. The correlation study between SalePrice and space variables supports this.
 - 3. The correlation study between SalePrice and YearBuilt supports this.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks

### Business Requirement 1:

- Study on the datasets and prepare a solid Pearson & Spearman Correlation report.

- Visualize the correlation relation between SalePrice and others

- Observe positive and negative correlated variables with SalePrice

- Pick the highest correlated variables to use for more.

### Business Requirement 2:

- Create and deliver a ML model which is able to predict the sale price of the four inherited houses and any house in Ames, Iowa.

- Conventional Machine Learning to map the relationships between the features and the target. This will be Involving:

- Test and choose machine learning techniques to find the model that works best for project's requirements and our needs.

## Acknowledgements

* This was the hardest project that I've done, I felt like there are too many details to be considered, I believe it was because this project is my first data analysis project so that I've kept it little bit basic. Thank you who has understanding.
* Thank you to all Code Institute students, especially to Slack Community.
* I believe, it would be fair if I say that I needed to see some of old projects, thank you to all Predictive Analytics students.
